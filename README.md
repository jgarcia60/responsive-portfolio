# Responsive Portfolio

## Description 

This project practices a knowledge of bootstrap and responsive web pages. It combines bootstrap grid containers with responsive applications and interactive features. With the current state of web accesibility from mobile devices, it is important to build web applications with responisve designs.

This portfolio attempts to replicate screenshots of a web page by designing a grid layout and using bootstrap with some custom CSS to match the screenshots with repsonsive applications.

One of the challenges in this assignment was getting the content text to wrap under the image in the index.html webpage. Another challenge was getting the Nav bar alignment to match the screenshots with their respsective responsive breakpoints. 

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
